# Web Pages

There are two main pages, the 'exercises' page and the 'plans' page. The 'exercises' page is where you can add and delete exercises and their descriptions. The 'plans' page is where you can create plans and add exercises to them. These plans and exercises are stored in localstorage.

Everything takes advantage of react's component system to dynamically render the values stored in localstorage.
